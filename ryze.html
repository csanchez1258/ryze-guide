    <h1>Ryze The Rune Mage</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <p>
        Ryze is a control and utility mage. He is mainly seen in the mid lane but is also viable top.
    </p>
    <p>
      I first started playing Ryze on my first year of playing League of Legends. I was told by my friend that he was a diffucult champ but was worth the effort in the long run.
      I got hooked on the champ and now he's my main. Im not the best Ryze main so take this guide with a grain of salt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this guide I will show case Ryze's abilities, combos, builds, and playstyle so that you can master Ryze and hopefully main him as well!

      <h3>Pasive: Arcane Mastery</h3>
      <p>
        Ryze's spells deal extra damage based on his Bonus Mana, and he gains a percentage increase to his maximum Mana based on
        his Ability Power.
      </p>
      <h3>Q: Overload</h3>
      <p>
        Passively, Ryze's other basic abilities reset the cooldown of Overload and charge a rune. When Ryze casts Overload with
        2 runes charged, he gains a brief burst of Move Speed. On cast, Ryze throws a charge of pure energy in a line, dealing
        damage to the first enemy struck. If the target has Flux on it, Overload deals extra damage and bounces to nearby
        enemies with Flux.
      </p>
      <h3>W: Rune Prison</h3>
      <p>
        Ryze traps a target in a cage of runes, damaging them and slowing their movement. If the target has Flux on it, they are
        instead rooted.
      </p>
      <h3>E: Spell Flux</h3>
      <p>
        Ryze releases an orb of pure magical power that damages an enemy and debuffs all nearby enemies. Ryze's spells have
        additional effects against the debuffed enemy.
      </p>
      <h3>R: Realm Warp</h3>
    <p>
      Passively, Overload deals even more damage against targets with Flux. On cast, Ryze creates a portal to a nearby
      location. After a few seconds, allies standing near the portal are teleported to the target location.
